## Description
_These are the steps we'll take to write our code:_

* _Convert a single digit number to a Roman numeral (1 to I)_
* _Convert numbers that evenly match a symbol (5 to V)_
* _Convert larger numbers using only addition (58 to LVIII)_
* _Convert numbers that have more than 3 in a row so it subtracts (9 to IX)_
* _Then separate ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, so 99 = XCIX_
* _Print message for invalid inputs_
